# TODO List:
# 2. Remaining features to implement:
#    - Mouse position in bottom right corner
#    - Background color selector in options menu
# 3. Convert all Kivy widgets to KivyMD counterparts


# 4. Figure out why it breaks with base_size > 100
# 5. Figure out why some groups stall at a certain radius - maybe issue with window resizing not working properly?
# 6. Figure out why initial spawn is not at radius = 0
# 7. Fix trail spacing so it is tighter
# 8. Figure out why trail spacing has gaps
